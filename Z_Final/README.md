# Agent-based model

Contains workthroughs of the practical exercises, as well as a final agent-based model, including agent framework.

## Dependencies

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

## Contents
- finalmodel.py: Agent-based model
- agentframework.py: Agent framework for model
- in.txt: Data for environment
- out.txt: Output of environment after model has been run

## Purpose

- Reads in data from a text file and plots this to an environment
- Creates agents that move around and eat the environment
- Lets agents know about each other
- Creates neighbourhoods that affect how agents interact with each other
- Generates an animated visualisation that shows the iterations of this process, as well as a .txt file that outputs the final eaten environment after the iterations have completed
