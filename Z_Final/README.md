# Agent-based model

- Reads in data from a text file and plots this to an environment
- Creates agents that move around and eat the environment
- Lets agents know about each other
- Creates neighbourhoods that affect how agents interact with each other
- Generates an animated visualisation that shows the iterations of this process, as well as a .txt file that outputs the final eaten environment after the iterations have completed

## Dependencies
